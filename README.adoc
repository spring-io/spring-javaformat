:release-version: 0.0.1
## Spring Java Format

### What is this?
A set of plugins that can be applied to any Java project to provide a consistent "`Spring`" style.
The set currently consists of:

* A source formatter that applies wrapping and whitespace conventions
* A checkstyle plugin that enforces consistency across a codebase

Since the aim of this project is to provide consistency, each plugin is not generally configurable.
You need to change your code to match the required conventions.
You can't configure the plugin conventions to match your style!

### Maven

#### Source Formatting

For source formatting, add the `spring-javaformat-maven-plugin` to your `build` plugins as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="normal"]
----
	<build>
		<plugins>
			<plugin>
				<groupId>io.spring.javaformat</groupId>
				<artifactId>spring-javaformat-maven-plugin</artifactId>
				<version>{release-version}</version>
			</plugin>
		</plugins>
	</build>
----

You can now run `./mvnw spring-javaformat:apply` to reformat code.

If you want to enforce that all code matches the required style, add the following:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="normal"]
----
	<build>
		<plugins>
			<plugin>
				<groupId>io.spring.javaformat</groupId>
				<artifactId>spring-javaformat-maven-plugin</artifactId>
				<version>{release-version}</version>
				<executions>
					<execution>
						<phase>validate</phase>
						<inherited>true</inherited>
						<goals>
							<goal>validate</goal>
						</goals>
					</execution>
				</executions>
			</plugin>
		</plugins>
	</build>
----

#### Checkstyle

To enforce checksyle conventions add the checkstyle plugin and include a dependency on `spring-javaformat-checkstyle`:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="normal"]
----
	<build>
		<plugins>
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
				<artifactId>maven-checkstyle-plugin</artifactId>
				<version>3.0.0</version>
				<dependencies>
					<dependency>
						<groupId>com.puppycrawl.tools</groupId>
						<artifactId>checkstyle</artifactId>
						<version>8.8</version>
					</dependency>
					<dependency>
						<groupId>io.spring.javaformat</groupId>
						<artifactId>spring-javaformat-checkstyle</artifactId>
						<version>{release-version}</version>
					</dependency>
				</dependencies>
				<executions>
					<execution>
						<id>checkstyle-validation</id>
						<phase>validate</phase>
						<inherited>true</inherited>
						<configuration>
							<configLocation>io/spring/javaformat/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml</configLocation>
							<includeTestSourceDirectory>true</includeTestSourceDirectory>
						</configuration>
						<goals>
							<goal>check</goal>
						</goals>
					</execution>
				</executions>
			</plugin>
		</plugins>
	</build>
----

### Gradle

#### Source Formatting
For source formatting, add the `spring-javaformat-gradle-plugin` to your `build` plugins as follows:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="normal"]
----
	buildscript {
		repositories {
			mavenCentral()
		}
		dependencies {
			classpath("io.spring.javaformat:spring-javaformat-gradle-plugin:{release-version}")
		}
	}

	apply plugin: 'io.spring.javaformat'
----

The plugin adds `format` and `checkFormat` tasks to your project.
The `checkFormat` task is automatically applied when running the standard Gradle `check` task.

#### Checkstyle
To enforce checksyle conventions add the checkstyle plugin and include a dependency on `spring-javaformat-checkstyle`:

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="normal"]
----
apply plugin: 'checkstyle'

checkstyle {
	toolVersion = "8.9"
}

dependencies {
	checkstyle("io.spring.javaformat:spring-javaformat-checkstyle:{release-version}")
}
----

Your `src/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml` file should look then like this:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<!DOCTYPE module PUBLIC "-//Puppy Crawl//DTD Check Configuration 1.3//EN" "http://www.puppycrawl.com/dtds/configuration_1_3.dtd">
	<module name="com.puppycrawl.tools.checkstyle.Checker">
		<module name="io.spring.javaformat.checkstyle.SpringChecks" />
	</module>
----


### Eclipse
The Eclipse plugin provides a custom formatter implementation and automatically applies project specific settings.
The plugin is automatically activated whenever the Maven or Gradle plugins are discovered in a project build script.

If you need to customize the project specific settings that the plugin applies you should add a `.eclipse` folder in the root of your project.
All `.prefs` files from this folder will be copied to the project `.settings` folders.
Usually you'll provide your own `org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs` and `org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs` files.

You can also add a `.eclipse/eclipse.properties` file to customize the following items:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	copyright-year= # The copyright year to use in new files
----

To install the plugin use the `io.spring.javaformat.eclipse.site` zip file.
You can download the latest version from http://repo.spring.io/release/io/spring/javaformat/io.spring.javaformat.eclipse.site/{release-version}[repo.spring.io] or use the https://dl.bintray.com/spring/javaformat-eclipse/[update site].

### IntelliJ IDEA
The IntelliJ plugin provides custom formatter support for IDEA.
The plugin is automatically activated whenever the Maven or Gradle plugins are discovered in a project build script.

To install the plugin use the `spring-javaformat-intellij-plugin` jar file.
You can download the latest version from http://repo.spring.io/release/io/spring/javaformat/spring-javaformat-intellij-plugin/{release-version}[repo.spring.io].


### About the conventions
Most of the coding conventions and style comes from the Spring Framework and Spring Boot projects.
Spring Framework manually formats code, where as Spring Boot uses automatic formatting.

### Tips
Formatting and Checkstyle alone are not enough to produce truly consistent code.
Here are some tips that we've found useful when developing Spring Boot.

#### Wrapping
The source formatter intentionally uses a low character count of 90 chars for wrapping.
If you're used to longer lines, this can take some getting used to.
Specifically, if you have many nesting levels things can start to look quite bad.

Generally, if you see code bunched up to the right of your screen you should take that as a signal to use the "`extract method`" refactor.
Extracting small private methods will improve formatting and it helps when reading the code and debugging.

#### Whitespace
Keeping whitespace lines out method bodies can help make the code easier to scan.
If blank lines are only included between methods it becomes easier to see the overall structure of the class.
If you find you need whitespace inside your method, consider if extracting a private method might give a better result.

#### Comments
Try to add javadoc for each public method and constant.
Private methods shouldn't generally need javadoc, unless it provides a natural place to document unusual behavior.

The checkstyle rules will enforce that all public classes have javadoc.
They will also ensure that `@author` tags are well formed.

#### Final
Private members should be `final` whenever possible.
Local variable and parameters should generally not be explicitly declared as final since it adds so much noise.

#### Read-down methods, fields and parameters
Methods don't need to be organized by scope.
There's no need to group all `private`, `protected` and `public` methods together.
Instead try to make your code easy to read when scanning the file from top to bottom.
In other words, try to have methods only reference method further down in the file.
Keep private methods as close to the thing that calls them as possible.

It's also recommend that you try to keep consistent ordering with fields and constructor parameters.
For example:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="normal"]
----
class Name {

	private final String first;

	private final String last;

	public Name(String first, String last) {
		this.first = first;
		this.last = last;
	}

}
----
